# Medja

A cross platform UI Framework purposed for Embedded Devices using SkiaSharp and OpenTK.

Mainly developed under Linux, partially tested under Windows and MacOS, but should work, since both SkiaSharp and OpenTK supports it.

- [Documentation](docs/README.md)
- [License](License.md)

# Features

- DataBinding (~1000 times as fast as WPF on .NET 4.7)
- Theming
- Good set of default controls (Button, Slider, ProgressBar, TextBox, ...)
- Touch UI
- Integration of 3D OpenGL into 2D Views
- Extensability
- Layouting (via different layout containers, like StackPanel, DockPanel, ...)

Still missing
- UI without Code (f.e. via a markup language)
- Validation
- More controls
